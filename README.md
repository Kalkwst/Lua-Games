# Lua Games

Welcome to my personal project - a collection of games implemented in Lua. These games are not designed as teaching tools, but are a showcase of what I've learned and created while exploring the Lua programming language. I believe that they are pretty cool and I hope you'll enjoy them as much as I enjoyed creating them.

## Inspiration
The original idea of these games is based on this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/lua-love/). While the games have been implemented by me as part of my learning journey, the initial concepts and ideas are inspired by the course.

## Games

### 1. Shooting Gallery

The first game in this collection is a **Shooting Gallery** game. In this game, you have a time limit of **10 seconds** to shoot a target as many times as you can.

#### How to play

Move your crosshair onto the target and click to shoot. The scoring system is as follows:
- A **left click** awards **one point**.
- A **right click** awards **two points**, but removes **one second** from the timer.

Be careful, if you miss the target, a point will be deducted from your score. So, aim carefully and try to score as high as you can within the time limit!
